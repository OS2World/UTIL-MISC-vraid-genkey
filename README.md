# UTIL-MISC-vraid-genkey
Key Generator for VRAID. 

The development of VRAID effectively stopped in 2001 however every once in a while someone comes around and asks for a key.  This archives contains an OS/2 exe to create your own key (as in: genkey.exe 2 "George Clooney") and the sourcecode of the generator.  Complete sourcecode of all my OS/2 drivers is available at Netlabs.
